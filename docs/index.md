# People's Agent - The AI Second Brain 🧠

**Welcome to the People's Agent Documentation Portal.**

People's Agent is a "Co-Cognitive System" designed to bridge the gap between static note storage and dynamic thought synthesis. Unlike traditional note-taking apps that act as passive filing cabinets, People's Agent actively participates in your thinking process.

## Philosophy

### 1. Zero-Taxonomy
We believe you shouldn't have to decide "where" a note goes before you write it. Dump your raw thoughts, and our **Automated Classification Agents** will route them to the correct Project, Area, or Resource.

### 2. Active Synthesis
Data should not just sit there. Our **Synthesis Agents** work in the background to:
- Build profiles of the people you know
- Track the status of your projects
- Organize your meetings
- Connect disparate ideas (Serendipity)

### 3. Glass Box Design
Trust is paramount. The AI explains its reasoning—why it connected two notes, why it classified a task as urgent, and how it derived an insight.

## Core Capabilities

- **Hybrid Memory**: Combines Vector Search (Semantics) with Knowledge Graphs (Structure).
- **Agentic Workflow**: Specialized agents for Extraction, Synthesis, and Decomposition.
- **Privacy First**: Self-hosted architecture using local LLMs (Ollama) and local databases.
